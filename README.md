Altschool Third Semester Exam Project.
About the Project-Create a new vue js application then using the GitHub API, fetch your GitHub repositories using this endpoint https://api.github.com/users/{{USERNAME}}/repos. show a page with a list of all your repositories on GitHub(the page should have some form of pagination). Then create another page showing data for a single repo clicked from the list of repos using nested routes. Make sure to implement a wildcard route to catch 404 pages. NB: Good UI and Designs are important.

In this Project- 
(i). I was able to Fetch my Github Details from the Github api and consume it.
(ii).I also repeated the same Process to display my Public  Github repositories.
(iii). I learnt more about Pagination with Vue JS in which i created a previous and next button to display  repositories per page and also about nested Routes(which poised to me some challenges)
